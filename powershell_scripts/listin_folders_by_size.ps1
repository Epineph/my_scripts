.SYNOPSIS
    This script lists the top 40 folders by size within a specified directory and allows the user to remove selected folders.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script takes a directory path as input and calculates the size of each folder within that directory recursively.
    It then ranks the folders by size and displays the top 40. The user can input the numbers corresponding to the folders
    they want to remove. The script calculates the total space that will be freed and prompts the user for confirmation
    before proceeding with the deletion.

.PARAMETER Path
    The directory path to analyze. If not provided, the script will prompt the user to enter a path.

.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\ListAndRemoveFolders.ps1 -Path "C:\Users\heini\Documents"
    1. ProjectA - 4.56 GB
    2. ProjectB - 3.23 GB
    3. Backup - 2.67 GB
    ...
    Enter the folder numbers to remove (e.g., 1,3,5-9): 2,3
    You are about to remove the following folders:
    - ProjectB
    - Backup
    Total space to be freed: 5.90 GB
    Are you sure you want to proceed? (yes/no): yes

.NOTES
    The script requires the user to have appropriate permissions to delete the folders. Use with caution as the operation
    is irreversible.
